Mothership abilities
1. Spawn drone ships
	- Help attack neutral space invaders and other player
	- Ball reflects off them
		- Die from reflection only if the ball was last touched by the opposing player
2. Mothership-mounted gun
	- Must be shot down by the opposing player
	- Guarded by mothership shield
3. Big honkin' lazer

Design idea:
	- When the containment breaks, the ball flies in a less predictable fashion to the player who DIDN'T hit it last
