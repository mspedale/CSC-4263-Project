Due: April 25th / 27th

Requirements:
- Maximum length of 15 minutes (no minimum length)
- Each team member must talk
- No Powerpoint
- Must present game running in Unity (no videos)
- Kooima will pull game code from GitHub on Friday, May 5th (5PM), 
  so we have some additional time to work after the 25th / 27th
  (but the presentation grade is based on the game at presentation time)
- Final grade depends on three factors:
  1) Quality of final presentation
  2) Quality of the game itself when Kooima pulls the repo
  3) Individual Participation (number of commits and lines of code added)

Kooima's Tips (On Moodle)
Show the game. One Unity project. Nothing more.
Focus on the good.
Emphasize where the effort went.
- Game design, art, sound 
Demonstrate everything, from the title screen to the final boss (if there is one). Implement a cheat code if necessary.
- Show menus, credits, how to play, and then play a few matches
Budget your time to ensure that every feature is shown.
Budget your time to ensure that every team member can describe their contribution.
Credit any content that you did not develop yourself.
- Patrick Richardson for BitJunkie logo
Explain what you did to make the game fun.
Note any trade-offs that you made.
Note what you would do differently, given the chance.
ALL team members must be involved and must speak. Rehearse to ensure you use your time well.
