Due: April 25th / 27th

Requirements:
- Maximum length of 15 minutes (no minimum length)
- Each team member must talk
- No Powerpoint
- Must present game running in Unity (no videos)
- Kooima will pull game code from GitHub on Friday, April 28th, 
  so we have some additional time to work after the 25th / 27th
  (but the presentation grade is based on the game at presentation time)
- Final grade depends on three factors:
  1) Quality of final presentation
  2) Quality of the game itself when Kooima pulls the repo
  3) Individual Participation (number of commits and lines of code added)

Presentation:
- Demonstrate full game. Should go through main menu, show off non-game menu screens, play a match of Pong Invaders.
