Game mechanic additions
------------------------


1. Player Damage
	- Player paddles will have HP.
	- HP will decrease when shot by another player or space invader enemy.
	- When HP is 0, paddle will temporarily destroy or deactivate. 

2. Space Invader enemies - In Progress (Cam)
	a. Spawn with containment
	b. Ball interaction
		- The ball reflects off the space invaders, destroying them. The interaction is similar to wall interactions. X or Y velocity is simply made negative.
	c. Destroy upon contact with player projectile -- done
	d. Shoot their own projectiles
		- They will shoot their own projectiles, unique from player projectiles.
		- These projectiles damage players and their motherships (if the shield is down), but do not affect the ball.
	e. Movement
		- Similar to the original "Space Invaders," they will move horizontally from one side of the screen to the other, 
		  advancing vertically each time they reach a horizontal edge.
		- As they advance toward a player, they shoot more often.
	   	- If allowed to advance to maximum, they kimikaze attack the player or mothership.

3. Mothership Abilities
	a. Fighter Drones
		- Defend the player and the mothership
		- Located between the mothership's shield and the player's line of movement
		- Shoot projectiles 
		- Useful for quickly taking down space invaders
		- Reflect the ball toward the opposing player.
		- Destroyed by enemy projectiles
		
		- design idea: Have fighter drones and mounted guns fire when the player has the fire button pressed.
				unlike the player's gun, they keep firing when the button is held down.

	b. Mounted Guns
		- Big guns mounted on the mothership.  These projectiles do considerable damage
		- The mothership's shield defends the guns from attack.
		- Must be taken out either by the player, or the opposing mothership's mounted guns.

	c. Big honkin' lazer
		- A huge lazer that comes from the center of the mothership.  Does massive damage!
		- It can penetrate an enemy mothership's shields, but that will mean it does less damage overall.
		- The opposing player can absorb some of the damage with their paddle, if need be.

4. Acquired gun upgrades


5. Sound Design (Matt)
        - Standardize sounds for a more unified design (similar cuttoffs, lengths, etc.)
        - Work on array function for randomizing sound to avoid redundancy on effects that repeat often (ball collision, laser, etc)
        - (Implemented comment for this in ballscript, test later)

Completed Tasks
---------------

1. Containment movement - Completed (Cam)
	- Make the containment move in a way that makes it more fun to shoot competitively
		- Suggested to make it oscillate. It'll be easier to hit when it's close to a wall,
		  but if you're skilled enough to hit it when it's in the middle of the stage, you'll
		  have more frequent opportunities to hit it!
	- It should be stationary until it gets hit the first time.
	- The more it gets shot, the faster it moves.  

2. Mothership damage - Completed (Jonah)
	- Mothership has an hp, which is reduced by enemy projectiles while the shield is down.
	- We'll need to implement a damage system with projectiles.  
		-Create projectile tag and add 'damage' as a global variable of projectile.
	- When hp is zero, that player loses!

3. Mothership shields - Completed (Jonah)
	- blocks projectiles from coming in contact with the mothership
	- destroy (or deactivate: awake = false) upon contact with the ball
	- Stay destroyed or deactivated for a certain (reasonably long) amount of time.
	- Respawn the containment upon reactivation

4. Player Projectiles affecting the ball - Functioning, needs revision (Cam)
	- Instead of an outward force coming from the projectile center point, compare 
	  ball and projectile x-values and distribute x/y forces imparted directly on the ball.
	  (diagram in notebook)
	  
5. Main Menu Screen - Functioning, needs revision (Matt)
	- Same BG as main game for simple transition to matches
	- Multiple buttons for different scenes, such as Play Game, How To Play, Credits
	- Exit Game button for easy quitting
	- Should have space for Pong Invaders and BitJunkie logos
	
6. Pause Menu - Functioning, needs revision (Matt)
	- Pause game when escape key is pressed
	- Buttons to resume game, restart game, or return to main menu
