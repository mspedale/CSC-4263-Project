Game mechanic additions
------------------------
1. Mothership damage
	- Mothership has an hp, which is reduced by enemy projectiles while the shield is down.
	- We'll need to implement a damage system with projectiles.  
		-Create projectile tag and add 'damage' as a global variable of projectile.
	- When hp is zero, that player loses!

2. Mothership shields
	- blocks projectiles from coming in contact with the mothership
	- destroy (or deactivate: awake = false) upon contact with the ball
	- Stay destroyed or deactivated for a certain (reasonably long) amount of time.
	- Respawn the containment upon reactivation

3. Containment movement
	- Make the containment move in a way that makes it more fun to shoot competitively
		- Suggested to make it oscillate. It'll be easier to hit when it's close to a wall,
		  but if you're skilled enough to hit it when it's in the middle of the stage, you'll
		  have more frequent opportunities to hit it!
	- It should be stationary until it gets hit the first time.
	- The more it gets shot, the faster it moves.  

4. Player Damage
	- Player paddles will have HP.
	- HP will decrease when shot by another player or space invader enemy.
	- When HP is 0, paddle will temporarily destroy or deactivate.
