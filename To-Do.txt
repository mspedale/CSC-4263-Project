1. Space Invader enemies - In Progress (Cam)
	a. Spawn with containment -- Done
	b. Ball interaction --- Done
		- The ball reflects off the space invaders, destroying them. The interaction is similar to wall interactions. X or Y velocity is simply made negative.
	c. Destroy upon contact with player projectile -- Done
	d. Shoot their own projectiles
		- They will shoot their own projectiles, unique from player projectiles.  -- Done
		- These projectiles damage players and their motherships (if the shield is down), but do not affect the ball. -- Done
	e. Movement  -- In Progress
		- Similar to the original "Space Invaders," they will move horizontally from one side of the screen to the other, 
		  advancing vertically each time they reach a horizontal edge.	-- Done
		- As they advance toward a player, they shoot more often.
	   	- If allowed to advance to maximum, they kimikaze attack the player or mothership.
		- When a new wave spawns, move down far enough so the two waves don't collide.

2. Containment startup
	- The direction in starts moving in depends on whether it was hit on the right or the left.
		
2. Kooima Notes from Presentation:
	- Indication for when fighter ship is disabled (visual and audio)
	- Invaders just fly towards the mothership forever (either have them move forward and back, or die when they collide)
	- Make the energy more distinct from projectiles (maybe fly towards a meter on the sides instead of motherships)

3. Player Projectiles affecting the ball - Functioning, needs revision (Cam)
	- Instead of an outward force coming from the projectile center point, compare 
	  ball and projectile x-values and distribute x/y forces imparted directly on the ball.

Game Mechanic Additions (Low Priority) 
-------------------------------------

1. Mothership Abilities
	a. Fighter Drones  -- In Progress (Cam)
		- Defend the player and the mothership
		- Located between the mothership's shield and the player's line of movement
		- Shoot projectiles 
		- Useful for quickly taking down space invaders
		- Reflect the ball toward the opposing player.
		- Destroyed by enemy projectiles
		
		- Design idea: Have fighter drones and mounted guns fire when the player has the fire button pressed.
				unlike the player's gun, they keep firing when the button is held down.

	b. Mounted Guns
		- Big guns mounted on the mothership.  These projectiles do considerable damage
		- The mothership's shield defends the guns from attack.
		- Must be taken out either by the player, or the opposing mothership's mounted guns.

	c. Big honkin' lazer
		- A huge lazer that comes from the center of the mothership.  Does massive damage!
		- It can penetrate an enemy mothership's shields, but that will mean it does less damage overall.
		- The opposing player can absorb some of the damage with their paddle, if need be.

2. Acquired gun upgrades

--------------
 Aesthetics
--------------
1. Paddle Life Bar

2. Paddle "Disabled" indicator

3. Paddle Gun Cooldown Animation

4. Invader and Drone pre-shoot animation (so players get fair warning)


------------
 Idea bin
------------

1. Make bullet cooldown for normal gun dependant on amounts of bullets on screen.

2. Allow the players a limited range of y-movement.
   - Adds a risk-reward aspect of movement.
   - If idea 1 is implemented, this allows the player to shoot more rapidly

---------------
Completed Tasks
---------------

1. Containment movement - Complete (Cam)
	- Make the containment move in a way that makes it more fun to shoot competitively
		- Suggested to make it oscillate. It'll be easier to hit when it's close to a wall,
		  but if you're skilled enough to hit it when it's in the middle of the stage, you'll
		  have more frequent opportunities to hit it!
	- It should be stationary until it gets hit the first time.
	- The more it gets shot, the faster it moves.  

2. Mothership damage - Complete (Jonah)
	- Mothership has an hp, which is reduced by enemy projectiles while the shield is down.
	- We'll need to implement a damage system with projectiles.  
		-Create projectile tag and add 'damage' as a global variable of projectile.
	- When hp is zero, that player loses!

3. Mothership shields - Complete (Jonah)
	- blocks projectiles from coming in contact with the mothership
	- destroy (or deactivate: awake = false) upon contact with the ball
	- Stay destroyed or deactivated for a certain (reasonably long) amount of time.
	- Respawn the containment upon reactivation

4. Player Projectiles affecting the ball - Functioning, needs revision (Cam)   >> See "Game Mechanic Additions" (Low Priority)
	
	  
5. Main Menu Screen - Completed (Matt)
	- Same BG as main game for simple transition to matches
	- Multiple buttons for different scenes, such as Play Game, How To Play, Credits
	- Exit Game button for easy quitting
	- Should have space for Pong Invaders and BitJunkie logos
	
6. Pause Menu - Completed (Matt)
	- Pause game when escape key is pressed
	- Buttons to resume game, restart game, or return to main menu
	- Currently two bugs: 
		~Ball container shifts positions when unpaused (Fixed)
		~Players can fire one shot during pause (Fixed)
		~Should be fixable by consolidating time variables (Time.time and Time.timescale)
		-Fixed w/ local bools and if statements
	
7. How to Play Menu - Completed (Matt)
        - Accessible from Main Menu
	- Should teach players how the game works without too much information
	- Contains functionality to add more pages if needed
	
8. End State - Completed (Matt)
	- Game needs to have a definite end. Can be handled one of two ways:
		a) When a player's mothership is destroyed, the game ends. The surviving player wins. -- This is what we went with
		b) When a player's mothership is destroyed, the round ends. The surviving player is awarded a point,
		   and the game ends when one player reaches a certain number of points. The first player to score
		   that amount of points wins.
	- Upon the game ending, a menu should appear that allows the player to start another game, exit to the main menu,
	  or exit the game completely.
	  
9. Player Damage - Completed (Jonah)
	- Player paddles will have HP.   
	- HP will decrease when shot by another player or space invader enemy. 
	- When HP is 0, paddle will temporarily destroy or deactivate.
	
10. Sound Design - Completed for final presentation (Matt)
